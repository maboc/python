# Small Math problem demonstrations

This small collection of programs tries to show some math problems.
Some remarks upfront:
- Almost all programs in this collection need numpy and graphics.py
These libraries can be installed with pip:
```
pip3 install http://bit.ly/csc161graphics
pip3 install numpy
```
- Python does not seem to be the best choice for generating images etc. It's quite slow. So don't expect any pefromance (au contraire)
- I'm not worlds best programmer....don't expect beautifull code
- Whenever a problem seems to be solved I loose my interest a bit....so there are a lot improvements possible

Programs in this collection:
[programs](julia.py)

### julia.py 
Purpose       : generates pictures of julia set

Remarks       :
